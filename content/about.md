Hi Iâ€™m Anja. (pronounce the J like a Y, german alphabet ðŸ˜Š)

I have a natural tendency to count things, it started with sheep when I had trouble going to sleep. This led me to an apprenticeship in accounting in 1990 in Germany. Since then Iâ€™ve been wondering about better ways to capture numbers and monitor business performance in real time. In the accounting practices we only got to look at the numbers after the year was over to prepare the tax returns.

I came across Xero accounting software when it started in New Zealand in the year 2006. It immediately made sense to me to use automation to import and code bank account transactions daily and see the performance. The functionality has grown hugely, now itâ€™s easy to identify unique indicators and set flags to act rather than react. 

When I help setting up the Xero Accounting Software I love exploring indicators and parameters, a truly collaborative approach to find out what makes the business tick and hum.

Users love how easy they can send invoices from Xero. It takes the hassle out of the compliance like GST, Payroll and PAYE and fixed assets and depreciation. Thereâ€™s template reports for the end of year Financial Statements which are the basis for income tax returns.

Starting something new comes easy to me. I have seen many businesses start and some fail. The world is changing and I love helping others to get the business values right from the start. Itâ€™s also about breaking old habits and patterns that donâ€™t work when applied to a new business.
